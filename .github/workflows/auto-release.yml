name: Auto-release on sync PR merge

# Triggered when a sync/hle-client-v* PR is merged into main.
# Creates a GitHub PRE-RELEASE, which triggers the Docker build workflow.
# The build workflow bumps config.yaml and promotes to a full release only
# after the image is confirmed pushed — preventing HA Supervisor from seeing
# the new version before the image is available.
